\arguments{
\item{formula}{A \code{formula} object, corresponding to the spatial factor analysis model. The response must be on the left of a \code{~} operator, and the terms on the right 
must indicate the covariates to be included in the fixed effects. If no covariates are desired a zero should be used, \code{~ 0}.}

\item{data}{A required \code{data.frame} containing the variables (\code{Y}, additional \code{x} coviariate(s) if there is/are, and a \code{trials} variable if there
is/are observation type(s) from \code{family "binomial"}) in the model. The data frame must contain \code{M x O x Nu} rows.
Here, \code{M} represents the number of spatial locations, \code{O} the number of different observation types
and \code{Nu} the number of temporal visits. The observations must be first
ordered spatially, second by observation type and then temporally. This means that the first \code{M x O} observations come from the first time point and
the first \code{M} observations come the first spatial observation type.
If there is/are observation type(s) from \code{family "binomial"}, then \code{trials} contains the numbers of trials as positive integers for each of the binomial observations.
Entries in \code{trials} corresponding to non-binomial data can be specified as any arbitrary positive integer. The function will change these values to 1.}

\item{dist}{A \code{M x M} dimensional distance matrix. For a \code{discrete} spatial process the matrix contains binary adjacencies that dictate the
spatial neighborhood structure and for \code{continuous} spatial processes the matrix should be a continuous distance matrix (e.g., Euclidean).}

\item{Nu}{A positive integer representing the number of evenly dispersed time points corresponding to our observed data.}

\item{K}{A scalar that indicates the dimension (i.e., quantity) of latent factors.}

\item{L}{A positive integer indicating the number of latent clusters for each column of the factor loadings matrix.}

\item{family}{A character string or a vector of length \code{O} (if \code{O > 1}) of character strings indicating the distribution(s) of the observed data. Options for each observation type
include: \code{"normal"}, \code{"probit"}, \code{"tobit"}, and \code{"binomial"}. If \code{O > 1} and \code{family} is of length 1, then all of the \code{O} observation types are from the same 
\code{family} (distribution). Any combination of likelihoods can be used.}

\item{spatial.structure}{Character string indicating the type of spatial process. Options include:
\code{"continuous"} (i.e., Gaussian process with exponential kernel) and \code{"discrete"} (i.e., proper CAR).}

\item{starting}{Either \code{NULL} or a \code{list} containing starting values
 to be specified for the MCMC sampler. If \code{NULL} is not chosen then none, some or all
 of the starting values may be specified.

 When \code{NULL} is chosen then default starting values are automatically generated.
 Otherwise a \code{list} must be provided with names \code{Beta}, \code{Delta}, \code{Sigma2}, \code{Kappa}, \code{Rho}, \code{Upsilon}, 
 or \code{A} containing appropriate objects. \code{Beta} (or \code{Delta}) must either be a \code{P} (or \code{K}) dimensional
 vector or a scalar (the scalar populates the entire vector). \code{Sigma2} must be either a \code{M x (O - C)} matrix or a scalar.
 \code{Kappa} must be a \code{O x O} dimensional matrix, \code{Rho} a scalar, and \code{Upsilon} a \code{K x K} matrix.}

\item{hypers}{Either \code{NULL} or a \code{list} containing hyperparameter values
 to be specified for the MCMC sampler. If \code{NULL} is not chosen then none, some or all
 of the hyperparameter values may be specified.

 When \code{NULL} is chosen then default hyperparameter values are automatically
 generated. These default hyperparameters are described in detail in (Berchuck et al.).
 Otherwise a \code{list} must be provided with names \code{Beta}, \code{Delta}, \code{Sigma2}, \code{Kappa}, \code{Rho}, 
 \code{Upsilon}, or \code{A} containing further hyperparameter information. These objects are themselves
 \code{lists} and may be constructed as follows.

 \code{Beta} is a \code{list} with two objects, \code{MuBeta} and \code{SigmaBeta}. These values represent the prior mean and variance 
 parameters for the multivariate normal prior.
 
 \code{Delta} is a \code{list} with two objects, \code{A1} and \code{A2}. These values represent the prior shape 
 parameters for the multiplicative Gamma shrinkage prior.
 
 \code{Sigma2} is a \code{list} with two objects, \code{A} and \code{B}. These values represent the shape and scale for the variance parameters.
 
 \code{Kappa} is a \code{list} with two objects,
 \code{SmallUpsilon} and \code{BigTheta}. \code{SmallUpsilon} represents the degrees of freedom parameter for the
 inverse-Wishart hyperprior and must be a real number scalar, while \code{BigTheta} represents
 the scale matrix and must be a \code{O x O} dimensional positive definite matrix.
 
 \code{Rho} is a \code{list} with two objects, \code{ARho} and \code{BRho}. \code{ARho}
 represents the lower bound for the uniform hyperprior, while \code{BRho} represents
 the upper bound. The bounds must be specified carefully. This is only specified for continuous spatial processes.
 
 \code{Upsilon} is a \code{list} with two objects,
 \code{Zeta} and \code{Omega}. \code{Zeta} represents the degrees of freedom parameter for the
 inverse-Wishart hyperprior and must be a real number scalar, while \code{Omega} represents
 the scale matrix and must be a \code{K x K} dimensional positive definite matrix.

 \code{A} is a \code{list} with two objects, \code{V} and \code{Mvec}. 
 \code{V} is a \code{K x K} dimensional positive definite matrix, and \code{Mvec} is a scale vector of length \code{K^2}.}

\item{tuning}{Either \code{NULL} or a \code{list} containing tuning values
 to be specified for the MCMC Metropolis steps. If \code{NULL} is not chosen then all
 of the tuning values must be specified.

 When \code{NULL} is chosen then default tuning values are automatically generated to
 \code{1}. Otherwise a \code{list} must be provided with name \code{Rho}. 
 Each of these entries must be scalars containing tuning variances for their corresponding Metropolis updates.}

\item{mcmc}{Either \code{NULL} or a \code{list} containing input values to be used
 for implementing the MCMC sampler. If \code{NULL} is not chosen then all
 of the MCMC input values must be specified.

 \code{NBurn}: The number of sampler scans included in the burn-in phase. (default =
 \code{10,000})

 \code{NSims}: The number of post-burn-in scans for which to perform the
  sampler. (default = \code{10,000})

 \code{NThin}: Value such that during the post-burn-in phase, only every
 \code{NThin}-th scan is recorded for use in posterior inference (For return values
 we define, NKeep = NSims / NThin (default = \code{1}).

 \code{NPilot}: The number of times during the burn-in phase that pilot adaptation
 is performed (default = \code{20})}

\item{seed}{An integer value used to set the seed for the random number generator}

\item{gamma.shrinkage}{A logical indicating whether a gamma shrinkage process prior is used for the variances of the factor loadings columns. If FALSE,
the hyperparameters (A1 and A2) indicate the shape and rate for a gamma prior on the precisions. Default is TRUE. It can only be TRUE when \code{clustering = TRUE}.}

\item{include.space}{A logical indicating whether a spatial process should be included. Default is TRUE, however if FALSE the spatial correlation matrix 
\code{F(\rho)} is fixed as the \code{M x M} identity matrix. This specification overrides the inputs \code{spatial.structure}, \code{spatApprox}, and \code{alphaMethod}.}

\item{clustering}{A logical indicating whether the Bayesian non-parametric process should be used, default is TRUE. If FALSE is specified
each column is instead modeled with an independent spatial process.}

\item{spatApprox}{A logical indicating whether spatial nearest neighbor kriging is used for the latent location-specific spatial parameter vectors \code{\alpha_{jl_j}}'s
to accelerate computation. Default is TRUE. When TRUE, \code{spatial.structure} must be \code{"continuous"}. If FALSE, the exact \code{M x M} neighborhood structure matrix \code{F(\rho)} 
is adopted throughout.}

\item{alphaMethod}{Character string indicating which approach is used to update the \code{\alpha_{jl_j}}'s in the Gibbs Sampler. 
Options include: \code{"block"} and \code{"sequential"}. This argument is only used when \code{include.space = TRUE} and \code{spatApprox = TRUE}.}

\item{h}{a positive integer much smaller than M, the number of location points, indicating an upper bound of the number of nearest neighbors for each location point.}

\item{storeSpatPredPara}{a logical indicating whether we want to store the posterior samples for Xi, Delta, Tau, Alpha, Theta when clustering = TRUE.
Has to be TRUE if we want to perform predictions at new spatial location(s). Can be FALSE to save storage space if spatial prediction is not required.}

\item{storeWeights}{a logical indicating whether we want to store the posterior Weights estimates when clustering = TRUE. Has to be TRUE
if we want to perform temporal trends clustering from the output object. Can be FALSE to save storage space if otherwise.}

\item{alphasWeightsToFiles}{a logical indicating whether we want to store the posterior alpha and weights estimates to files (one 
for each kept MCMC iteration) instead of including them in the main output list. Can only be TRUE if \code{clustering = TRUE} 
and at least one of \code{storeSpatPredPara} and \code{storeWeights} is TRUE. When that is the case, specifying \code{alphasWeightsToFiles = TRUE} 
would be immensely useful if we don't have enough space to output a model fit object with all kept posterior parameter estimates.
Default is FALSE.}
